# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  
- Created Users controller and User model

I'm creating a web app to test clear cache function of a web browser.  
Something like this: https://enigmatic-anchorage-96854.herokuapp.com/

It intentionally caches the image for testing purpose.  
I'm thinking this app can be used to test whether a browser's clear cache function is working or not.  
(My current job is a tester and I have been testing a web browser app recently. That's why I got interested in building this.)

I created the page above by modifying the toy_app sample in Rails Tutorial, so it has many unnecessary functions/codes.

Now I'm trying to develop it while going through the tutorial from Chapter 3, but this time trying to understand "which code does what" more clearly, and customize it to suit my purpose.

### Day 4: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  
- Create edit/delete user functions
- Create functions related to admin user

**Thoughts:**  
I decided to join #100DaysOfCode challenge!  
I'm a 三日坊主 person, but it is now Day 4 and Github contributions graph is showing 8 Days streak (thanks to timezone difference) I started feeling like I can do it.

### Day 5: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  
- Implement Micropost
- Disable User & Login features

**Thoughts:**  
I realized that I might not need the User & Login features for my purpose... So I disabled them.
I might remove unnecessary codes later, but I learned a lot from implementing them. Deeper understanding helped me implementing Micropost feature.

### Day 6: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  
- Image upload function
- Force cache the uploaded image so that the user needs to hard refresh the browser to see the new image

**Thoughts:**  
I completed implementing all the features I wanted.  
I will do some more layout work tomorrow, and then I will make it public.

It is very inspiring to see everyone tweeting using #100DaysOfCode . 自分がチャレンジに参加するまではそんなに感じなかったのですが、急に身近にというか、当事者の気持ちになるものですね。

**Thoughts:**  
Deployed my first product in this challenge!

### Day 8: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  
- Submitted a pull request to 100-days-of-code repo

**Thoughts:**  
I'm not sure if working on Markdown can be counted as coding, but I wanted to experience the workflow of submitting a pull request to forked repo.  
Now I have gained some confidence and understanding in it.

### Day 9: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  
- Found out where the width is set
- Installed some packages to customize Sublime Text

**Thoughts:**  
I didn't have much progress today.  
I'm trying to improve the mobile view of my blog. The template is complicated and I spend long time to understand how it is working.
