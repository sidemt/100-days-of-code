# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress:**  
- Created Users controller and User model

I'm creating a web app to test clear cache function of a web browser.  
Something like this: https://enigmatic-anchorage-96854.herokuapp.com/

It intentionally caches the image for testing purpose.  
I'm thinking this app can be used to test whether a browser's clear cache function is working or not.  
(My current job is a tester and I have been testing a web browser app recently. That's why I got interested in building this.)

I created the page above by modifying the toy_app sample in Rails Tutorial, so it has many unnecessary functions/codes.

Now I'm trying to develop it while going through the tutorial from Chapter 3, but this time trying to understand "which code does what" more clearly, and customize it to suit my purpose.

**Thoughts:**  
I decided to join #100DaysOfCode challenge!  
I'm a 三日坊主 person, but it is now Day 4 and Github contributions graph is showing 8 Days streak (thanks to timezone difference) I started feeling like I can do it.
